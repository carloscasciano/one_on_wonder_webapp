### One on Wonder Web App

Hi! This is One on Wonder WebApp, you can find it online on: https://www.theoneonwonder.com/

This app was built to help managers or anyone who wishes to build better relations with their teams. It is currently on MVP stage.

Just out of curiosity, it was built with React and uses Pinterest Gestalt components, Axios, React Copy to Clipboard and React-GA to get Google Analytics user trackings.

It isn't the greatest code of all, because sometimes working code was chosen above beautiful code. Let's have a virtual coffee so I can explain some weird decisions and what is coming to change it!
